I am a passionate **Software Engineer**, **Tech Lead**, and **Open Source Advocate** with a robust background in building and scaling applications and systems. With extensive experience in **JavaScript**, **Elixir**, **Python**, and **Ruby**, I specialize in crafting efficient, scalable, and maintainable digital products.
